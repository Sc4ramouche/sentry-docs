Sentry metrics are numerical values that allow you to pinpoint and solve issues impacting user experience and app performance by measuring the data points that are important to you and your application. You can track things like latency, processing time, event size, user signups, and conversion rates, and see how they correlate back to tracing data. This gives you better observability, allowing you to gain a comprehensive understanding of the health of your systems and solve issues faster.

## Metric Types

Metrics at Sentry come in different flavors, in order to help you track your data in the most efficient and cost-effective way. The metric types we currently support are:

- **Counters** track a value that can only be incremented (for example, button clicks).
- **Distributions** track a list of values that can be aggregated over time, like `max`, `min`, and `avg` (for example, page load times).
- **Sets** track a set of values on which you can run aggregations over time, such as `count_unique` (for example, the number of unique users).
- **Gauges** track a value that can go up or down (for example, available disk space and memory used).
- **Timers** track the execution time for a specific block of code (for example, the time to load a user profile).

Each metric also needs to have a unit associated with it, so that you know what you're dealing with. Examples of units are seconds, milliseconds, bytes, or even potatoes if you like.

## Augmenting Metrics with Tags

Metrics are powerful on their own, but you can enrich them further by adding dimensions in the form of Tags. Tags are key/value string pairs (for example, `cuisine:Italian`) that add contextual information to your metrics. They can also be used to filter and group metrics during analysis.

By default, Sentry adds some standard tags, such as `transaction`, `environment`, and `release`. You can also create custom tags to track attributes that help organize your data for your specific use case. For example, some useful custom tags are browser name, region, language, and platform.

## Limits and Restrictions

### Cardinality

Cardinality, in the context of metrics, refers to how many unique time series your metrics create. The number of time series depends on the combinations of tags that are added to a metric.

When dealing with tags, it's important to be wary of cardinality explosion. Here's an example to help you understand what this means.

Suppose you're trying to make dinner plans and want your friends to vote on their preference. Each vote has two properties:

- Cuisine type: Type of restaurant (for example, Asian, Italian, German).
- Price: Price range of the restaurant (for example, $, $$, $$).

How would you count all the votes by type and price? The simple solution is to create multiple boxes that contain all the votes for each combination of type and price (Italian-$, German-$$). If you have 3 types and 3 prices, the resulting number of boxes you'd need would be 9, which is quite a lot.

Now imagine if a friend comes and says, let's also vote on the day of the month, which has 31 values. Now all the combinations go from 3 × 3 = 9 to 3 × 3 × 31 = 279. As you can see, adding multiple properties can quickly become overwhelming. This is what's known as a cardinality explosion.

To prevent such an explosion, you should use tags with a low number of distinct values. The end goal is to have a small product of possible tag values.

### Tags

Tag keys have a maximum length of 32 characters and can contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (\_), periods (.), colons (:), and dashes (-).

Tag values have a maximum length of 200 characters and cannot contain the newline (`\n`) character.

### Retention

Metrics are retained for 90 days in sentry.io (the same retention period as other event types, such as Errors and Transactions). The retention period is not configurable.
